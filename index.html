Hard work at the max doesnt matter whether it is agriculture or education. Always repents that he lacks in guidance , a direction, planning. Genuinity is at its best with him.Doesn't like lying and cheating. Outstanding memory power, may be it is the reason for completion of his education despite the time he got. Always ready to help his friends/colleagues. Found a funny side when he blames mummy and her family for his health condition. He is the best person who can convince Jejiya on a point. He is second quick person in reacting for a situation.Involves in lot of decisioning situations.";

Slowly emerged as a capable hand in dealing many situations like marriages, functions. Her endurance is the best of anyone. She had her own reasons for not being very generous. Got a tag for that, that she is not a very broad mind or very welcoming to the people who visits. She is much disciplined, agile, likes self-respect. Kids can be left at her care without a doubt.";

He loves to be clean, precise, accurate, and neat. Babai, likes to discuss with his brothers before taking a huge decisions. Discussed a lot with me while buying his car.  Having a good skill at cooking. Suggestion seeking may delay decision making. So, rarely comes short of a decision.";

He is the quickest of all to react to a situation. Good with humor bad with temper. Praising is his repertoire.";

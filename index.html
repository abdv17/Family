Just like a coconut. He is the arguably best farmer that my family produced ever.Man with a enormous amounts of patience.Travels very frequently between Maharashtra and TKG Padu.Always says to me earn quite enough money so that can help one.Afraid of taking impacting decisions and seldom comes late with a perfect decision.";

Bad with cooking few specific dishes and frankly agrees to the fact that she is not best cook in the family. Liked that frankness. Her husband and children are her world. She dont know anything except cooking, washing, praying god.";

Slowly emerged as a capable hand in dealing many situations like marriages, functions. Her endurance is the best of anyone. She had her own reasons for not being very generous. Got a tag for that, that she is not a very broad mind or very welcoming to the people who visits. She is much disciplined, agile, likes self-respect. Kids can be left at her care without a doubt.";
